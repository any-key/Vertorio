# Vertical-Factory-Building-Factorio-Mod
Factorio mod that uses dependencies on Factorissimo and Renai Transportation (and some scripts and prototypes and linked belts) to create the illusion of vertical resource movement and inserter spots inside the multiple floors of a factorissimo building.  Will also add 3D beacons.
